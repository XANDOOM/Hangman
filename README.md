# The Project
This project demonstrates how to digitalise the conventional pen-paper game Hangman using Java Fx. For this project, each round starts with a 6 letter unknown word and 5 lives.

## Hangman
For those that are unfamiliar with the game, here is a brief :  
At the start of every round a random word is selected. Each letter of the word is represented by an underscore.
The objective of the game is to figure out the word by guessing one letter at a time. If the letter guessed is contained in the word, the underscore is replaced by the 
letter for all the instances of the letter in the word. Else, if the letter is not contained in the word, the user looses a life and the picture of a stick man being hung
by a noose starts developing. If all lives are lost, the user looses the game. If all the letters are guessed, the user wins the game.
